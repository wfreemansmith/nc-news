## Set-up

In order for a developer to run the server once pulled to their local device, in the main folder please create the files ```.env.test``` and ```.env.development```.

These files provide different environment variables (database addresses) for the seed.js file, depending on whether it is run to set-up the database using real data or to test the database using example data.
